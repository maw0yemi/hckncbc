<p>This roadmap diagram was authored by Paul Jeremy. I encountered it while conducting research on cyber paths and certificates. 
I found it to be highly valuable.</p>
<!--<p> It's a very good ilustration of the most common sectors in cyber and thier certification.</p>-->
<p>The diagram serves as an excellent visual representation of the prevailing sectors within the field of 
cyber (networking, security, hacking)and their associated certifications.</p>
<!--<p>Each certification website can be accessed by directly clicking on it for more information or to enroll.</p>-->
